To assist our web page visitors in quenching their curosity and focus on pertinant sighting information, a filter was created in Javascript with the following fields availble to search:
* Date
* City
* State
* Country
* Shape (of the UFO!)

To execute the filter, a visitor inputs into each respective field the values they'd like to focus on. Pressing `Enter` executes the filter, with multiple field entries providing further refinement. Clearing a filter input plus the `Enter` keystroke also removes that particular field's filter inclusion.
