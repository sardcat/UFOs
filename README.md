# UFOs! (prepare to believe...)
JavaScript, Bootstrap, and X-Files.

## Overview
Are we alone? Diving into this growing question, a web page was created utilizing UFO sightings data with scripting in JavaScript to widen the mystery!

Building on the stylish simplicity of Bootstrap, our web page contains a mission statement giving a brief outline to spark an interest regarding the topic of UFOlogy.

To assist our web page visitors in quenching their curiosity and focus on pertinent sighting information, a filter was created in Javascript with the following fields available to search:
* Date
* City
* State
* Country
* Shape (of the UFO!)

To execute the filter, a visitor inputs into each respective field the values they'd like to focus on. Pressing `Enter` executes the filter, with multiple field entries providing further refinement. Clearing a filter input plus the `Enter` keystroke also removes that particular field's filter inclusion.

## Summary
One drawback to the new design is that after numerous filter input fields have been entered, there is a necessity to "blank" each one out individually to reset the filter without refreshing the page. A few additional capabilities would be to integrate a `Reset Field` button for each field and `Reset All` button to clear out all filters. Loosening the requirement in having to match exact letter cases and a more flexible or close-proximity to inputted value would be an overall quality-of-life improvement as well.
